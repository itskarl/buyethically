# THE CONSCIENTIOUS CONSUMER APP

![desktop](concon.gif)

### DESCRIPTION
This app is a tool to help consumers make more informed decisions about their daily purchases.
It uses your phone's camera as a barcode reader to give you information on a product's parent company. It displays a letter grade, a company's green rating, and its CSR score, and additional details. Ultimately, it gives a consumer the power to decide whether or not they want to support the company and its practices with their purchase.

### DESIGN
This is my first mobile-first web application. The site is optimized for the mobile devices and designed with a very user-friendly interface in mind.
The 'egg-man' character is sourced from Flaticon and utilized as a mascot for the site. His colors were utilized across the site for a cohesive look.

### LANGUAGES USED
Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, AJAX
